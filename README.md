# Papers that I love

This reposistory contains a series of papers that inspired me on my work, so this
pushed me to share them with all of you.

- **[Immutability changes everything](immutability_changes_everything.pdf)**
  >There is an inexorable trend towards storing and sending immutable data. We need immutability to coordinate at a distance and we can afford immutability, as storage gets cheaper.

- **[On the Impact of Outdated and Vulnerable Javascript Packages in Docker Images](outdated_vulnerable_javascript_packages_in_docker_images.pdf)**
>This paper empirically studies the impact of npm JavaScript package vulnerabilities in Docker images. We based our analysis on 961 images from three official repositories that use Node.js, and 1,099 security reports of packages available on npm, the most popular JavaScript package manager.
